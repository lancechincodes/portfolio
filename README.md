## Challenges 💪
Manipulating flexbox and media queries were difficult challenges yet so important to my growth as a developer. As simple as centering divs sound, I struggled with placing elements on the page where I intended them to be. However, after great persistence and trial and error, I am much more confident in both positioning elements correctly and adjusting them in mobile, tablet, laptop, and monitor perspectives.

## What's Next 🏁
Although the first version is complete, the marathon continues and so does my portfolio. For future improvements, I will implement more interactions on the homepage, a section for demoing deployed projects, and an "Our Innovative World" blog that scopes out the latest and greatest technology. 
## Reflection 🙌
I thoroughly enjoyed building this project! While not easy, it served as an amazing instructor – teaching me how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript are used collaboratively to create interactive and responsive webpages, the importance of git version control, and to approach challenges with an optimstic mindset. I hope you enjoyed my portfolio and feel free to leave me feedback!
