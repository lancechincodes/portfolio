## Challenges ðŸ’ª
Manipulating flexbox and using media queries were major hurdles I had to manuever. However, after persistence and trial and error, I am much more confident in my abilities with both and am proud of the vision that I brought to life. 

## Reflection ðŸ™Œ
I thoroughly enjoyed building this project! While it certainly wasn't easy, it helped me reinforce the relationship between CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive webpage. I hope you enjoy the finished product and thanks again for checking it out!
